# A Sample Folder Structure
Author: Ella Foster-Molina

Students are increasingly coming into the classroom trained on tablets, not computers. Tablets have many benefits for ease of use and engagement. However, they make many slightly advanced tasks difficult or impossible, including file and folder management.

Managing files and folders is useful for everyday computer tasks. It is essential for more advanced computing, such as project management, advanced research projects, coding, and data analysis. 

File and folder management starts with having a reasonable folder system. A folder system designed for students and faculty is downloadable in this repository, and a screenshot is included below.

The system follows a few principles:
  - Folders are still critical for adequate information management, especially for coding. Code needs to know the exact location of the files it reads in and the files it saves out. This requires a unique location and address for each file. Search tools and tags cannot guarantee a unique address for each file.
  - The folder names leverage the automatic alpha-numeric ordering used by both Window's File Explorer and Mac's Finder. 2025 Summer comes before 2025Fall in the file structure because a space comes before "F".
  - Many tasks are sortable according to semester or quarter. Our brains tend to remember time based sorting systems of this kind, making it easy to access these files again.
  - Some projects will not have an inherent time structure. It's up to you to decide how to organize your research projects and recipes.
  - Practice is the only way to solidify your file structure. You have to access your folder systems repeatedly to ingrain the structure into your memory.
